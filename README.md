# EllipsoidShaderModel

This is an implementation of the Ellipsoid Shader Model from Predicting Appearance from Measured Microgeometry of Metal Surfaces. 

## Project Setup

The project is contained in the EllipsoidModelProject folder. Simply direct Unity to this and open it. This was written in 2019.3 so if you're using a future version, it should update automatically.

Unity should be setup to use a linear color space, with no skybox. All scenes, models, data are located in the assets folder.

The main shader is located in the EllipsoidModel/Shader folder.
